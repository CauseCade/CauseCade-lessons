#### Diverging & Pass-Through Connection

We will now have a closer look at 2 of the 3 types of connections we have seen last lesson. The reason why I grouped these
connection types will become apparent below. Remember that these connections represent the way events/random variables can be related.


At first sight a diverging and pass through connection may seem no more related than the converging and pass through connection - 
after all they both share one 'causal arrow'. Trying to reason using our intuition also does not help too much. If we look at the 
behaviour of each variable when making observations, we may be able to figure things out. 


Let's think about the diverging case first. Let's for convenience assume we have A < B > C as a relationship. Lets also say we have high 
and low as options for each variable (true or false would also work fine), and [1] propose high B causes high C and A. What would you 
expect C to be in if you only know that A is high? Naturally, you would reason that C is also high. This is because with A high,
we reason this must mean the cause (B) must also be high, and if B is high, then C (which is an effect of B) must also be high.
So as it were, we first reasoned what the starting event (in the case of causality, where the cause precedes the effect - not true for
deterministic events) was, and then figured C from there (using [1]). Similar reasoning applies for knowing C. 


Now, let us look at the pass-through case, and see if this is any different. We have A > B > C as a relationship.
We propose [2] that High A causes high B, high B causes high C. So, if we have high A, we have high B and consequentiall high C. What if 
we only know B is high (nothing known about A,C)? Well, it should apparent C is high. We can also reason that if B is high, this must be 
because the cause (A) is also high. Thus, A must also be High. If we only know C is high, then we reason twice about the cause and find 
that A and B must both be high also. 


So, let's look at what we saw. For both diverging and pass-through connections, if we observe [...]


... In the next lesson we will look at the converging connection type, followed by a discussion.
