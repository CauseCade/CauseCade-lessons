### Adding and removing nodes

#### Adding a new node

To add a new node to the network, simply  <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_1">click the **(+)** button</span> 
in the lower right corner of the screen. If you have done this, a dialog window will pop up with all
the options for adding a node.

In this dialog you can enter the name of the node,number of states and parents and daughters. 
The name is the only property that can (currently) not be changed later. The number of states property is only relevant for the Bayesian Network,
and you will therefore not be able to see this property in the network canvas. We will go into more info into the
exact function of this property later. You can leave it at it's default value. The *parents* of a node are other nodes
(that are in the network) that will have an arrow pointing **towards** this node. the *daughters* of a node are those
that the node you are adding is pointing **towards** (as indicated by the arrow in the network canvas).

To see whether you understand this, let's try <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_2">adding a node</span> named "HasTail",
with 2 states, and as a parent the node "Animal". In order for this to work, the network Animals must be loaded. 
If this is not the case, please press reset and then load Animals.
