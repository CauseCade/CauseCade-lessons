### Loading your first network
*3 minute read*
#### Loading an existing network

Loading a network is really quite straightforward. Simply <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_1">press the *load* button</span> in in top left region and follow directions. A dialog window will pop up with three options: 1) load an example network 2) load a user submitted network 3) load local file. As of the current time, only example networks are supported, but as soon as saving becomes available the latter 2 should be added.
Let's start by <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_2">loading the network *animals*</span>.

*in the future, networks will come with a short description to help you choose before loading*
#### Manipulating a loaded network
So, now that we have loaded a network, you should see a visual representation of a network in the network canvas region. As you can see, you can drag the network plane around by pressing and holding down your left mouse button, and you can zoom in and out using the scroll wheel. Let's try  <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_3">clicking the node *class*</span> in this network. If everything has gone well, you should observe that the styling of the network has changed. The selected node remains untouched, but the other nodes have gone grey, with certain nodes now having a coloured outline. The ones with a colored outline represent nodes that are directly linked to the node you just selected. You will see that these styles applied to the network change when you select a different node. Why don't we <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_4">select node *Warmblooded*</span> to see this in action. To remove this styling, simply <span class="lessonGoal" id="goal_5">click the node</span> you have currently selected again. By having this styling applied, it becomes easier to see which nodes are relevant and which ones are not (relative to your selection).

*in the future, the network itself will become draggable, allowing users to rearrange nodes in more convenient geometries.*
