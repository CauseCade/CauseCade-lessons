*this lesson is under construction*

#### Overview

So last lessons we saw the behaviour of the three causal relationships between events that we could come up with. 
We also noticed any causal relationship could be constructed from these 3 basic types. We also noted that The divergent and pass-through
behaved in similar manners when it came to 'blocking' paths (through which 'information flows'), while convergent connections behaved
differently. We also noticed that whether a path is 'blocked' dependent on whether a certain node is observed.

*For a three node system of type A-B-C:*

we noticed that for divergent and pass-through connections evidence:
 - can pass from A to C, if B is not observed
 - cannot pass from A to C, if B is observed
 
 we noticed that for convergent connections evidence:
 - cannot pass from A to C, if B is not observed
 - can pass from A to C, if B is observed
 
 As you can see, the convergent connection behaves opposite to that of the divergent and pass-through connection.
 Remember that this is because of the fundamental difference in these types of causal relationships,
 and that this behaviour is logical from an intuitive point of view. 
 
 #### conditional independence
 
 The fact that random variables are independent depending on whether a third random variable is observed or not is a {...}
 
 #### D separation
 
 {...}
 
 #### An optional discussion 
 
 why cant we just flip the order? {...}
