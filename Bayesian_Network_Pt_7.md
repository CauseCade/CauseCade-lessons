Last lesson we saw that pass-through and diverging connections showed the same behaviour when it came to observing nodes. Is this true for any causal relations, perhaps also for Converging connections? Let's find out.

As we have a diverging connection, the simplest situation is A > B < C. [...]



... In the next lesson we will have a brief discussion of these connection types based of example 3 and discuss the implications of what we have seen.
